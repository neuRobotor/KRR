# Kernel Ridge Regression 
## with gaussian kernel and k-Fold ross-validation

#### KRR
The four Matlab scripts found in the root directory of this repository are tools for using the kernel ridge regression algorithms. With the use of these matlab scripts you can easily implement and evaluate the KRR algorithm on any set of continuous data. 

#### Walkthrough
The `/walkthrough` direcotry contains resources that were designed to explain the usage and inner workings of the KRR algorithms from the root directory. 

#### Double Perovskites
The `/double_perovskites` direcotry contains an example implementation of the KRR algorithms from this library. The goal is to learn to predict the bang-gaps of a material from it's chemical composition. 

#### Data
The `/data` direcotry contains all the data files used in the examples. `gaussian_data.csv` represents a 3-dimensional function with added gaussian noise. `double_perovskites_gap.xlsx` contains chemical compositions and accompanying band-gaps of 1306 different double perovskites.
